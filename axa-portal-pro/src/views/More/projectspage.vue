                    <h2>Point of Sale System Failed</h2>
                    <h4 style=" color: #5E7A8A;">
                        Major Fashion house and luxury goods company POS system crashed at 9pm on a weeknight
                    </h4>
                    <p style="font-size: larger;">
                        If you work in IT, you know that updates get pushed to systems and occasionally, there are
                        mistakes or crashes. One international retail boutique store experienced this firsthand when
                        their offshore IT department pushed a software update. However, instead of pushing the update to
                        the desktops, they accidentally pushed it to the store Point of Sale systems. This update caused
                        the POS systems to fail.
                    </p>
                    <h4 style=" color: #5E7A8A;">
                        System update crashed POS system in 40 locations
                    </h4>
                    <p style="font-size: larger;">
                        The clients reached out to AXA Professionals when the crash happened at 9 pm to let them know
                        they might need help. By 4 am, the client reached out again requesting technicians to be
                        dispatched. Without the POS systems working, the stores could not ring up sales or service their
                        customers – impacting the stores' customer service and finances.

                        AXA Professionals responded immediately with Level 1 Technicians who reported on location the
                        next morning at 40 locations throughout over 20 cities in the US. Their response time was less
                        than 2 hours.

                    <p style="font-size: larger;">
                        While onsite, the technicians acted as smart hands in communication with the overseas IT
                        department. The POS systems were back up and running in 4-6 hours. This quick response time
                        minimized the impact on customers and the financial impact of a major POS system outage.

                            recruiting process, they vet the technicians for technical expertise, and for cultural fit
                            within the company. By Sunday evening, AXA Pros had recruited, interviewed, and completed
                            the background checks that were needed so that all 20 technicians arrive onsite, at the
                            correct locations, and ready to work on Monday morning.
